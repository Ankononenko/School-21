### To do:

***== Develop an src/pong.c program for a two-player game, 
similar to Pong. To display the graphics, only use ASCII characters (with output 
to the terminal). You need to implement the step-by-step 
version using only the material of the course studied 
so far and the standard library.***

* ***Keys***:

***A/Z and K/M - to move the rackets;***

***Space Bar - to skip an action at a certain step of the game in step-by-step mode.***

* ***Graphics***

***The field is a 80 x 25-symbol rectangle.*** 

***Racket size is 3 symbols;*** 

***Ball size is 1 symbol.***

* ***UI/UX***

***When one of the players scores 21 points, congratulations to the winner are displayed on the screen and the game ends.==***

## Important notes:

* The game must be written in C, have a structured style, and run from the terminal; 
  
* Your source code will be tested by the static analyzer `cppcheck`, as well as the style linter `cpplint`. 
  
* Instructions on how to run these tests on your computer are in the `materials` folder. 
  
* We also recommend taking a look at the `code-samples` folder.

* It is forbidden to use dynamic memory

> When developing the game, follow 
the principles of structured programming of E. Dijkstra.
